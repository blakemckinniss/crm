Based on Cheddar's top-performing email campaigns:
- Successful subject lines often use:
  - Value propositions (2 for 1, 15% off, 20% off)
  - Emotional appeals (love, thank you, sweetheart)
  - Urgency and exclusivity
  - Holiday/seasonal themes
  - Emojis sparingly but effectively
- Best practices:
  - Keep subject lines concise (20-40 characters)
  - Lead with the offer or benefit
  - Use action-oriented language
  - Create FOMO with limited-time language
